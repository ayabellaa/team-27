**Presentation of My Work**  

**Introduction**  
Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone. Today, I am going to present my work, which focuses on data organization, estimation methods, and cost prediction techniques. I will walk you through the steps I took, including both successful and unsuccessful attempts, and discuss alternative approaches that can yield better results. Let's get started.

**1. Organizing Data for Efficient Processing**  
The first step in my work was structuring data in a way that makes it easier to analyze and process. I achieved this by organizing the data into a matrix format, which allows for efficient manipulation and computation. This was done using both **Python** and **Excel**, ensuring flexibility in handling the data. By structuring it this way, I was able to apply various computational methods efficiently and extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

**2. A Failed Experiment: Inverse Chain Method**  
Like any research or analytical process, trial and error play a significant role. One of the methods I initially attempted was the **inverse chain method** to estimate past values. The idea was to reverse the chain of calculations and then assess the efficiency of the obtained results.

- I wrote a **Python script** to automate the inverse calculation process.
- I then used **Excel** to analyze and validate the estimated values.
- However, upon calculating the efficiency of this approach, I found that the results were **highly inaccurate** and unreliable.

This led me to conclude that the **inverse chain method is not a suitable approach** for this type of estimation, prompting me to explore other techniques.

**3. Exploring Alternative Methods: Generalized Additive Models (GAM)**  
After identifying the limitations of the inverse chain method, I turned to alternative approaches. One of the promising methods is the **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)**.

- GAM is a statistical technique that allows for flexibility in modeling relationships between variables.
- It works well when dealing with non-linear dependencies.
- I implemented a **Python script** to test this approach and observed better performance in estimating past values.

This method provided more reliable results compared to the previous attempt, making it a viable option for estimation tasks.

**4. Bayesian Method for Future Cost Estimation**  
Next, I moved on to predicting future costs using a **Bayesian approach**. Bayesian estimation is a powerful statistical method that incorporates prior knowledge along with new data to improve prediction accuracy.

- **Mathematical Explanation:** The Bayesian method works by updating the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available. It follows the formula:
  
  \[ P(\theta | D) = \frac{P(D | \theta) P(\theta)}{P(D)} \]
  
  where:
  - \( P(\theta | D) \) is the posterior probability (updated belief about \( \theta \) after seeing data \( D \)).
  - \( P(D | \theta) \) is the likelihood (how probable is the data given \( \theta \)).
  - \( P(\theta) \) is the prior probability (initial belief about \( \theta \)).
  - \( P(D) \) is the evidence (total probability of observing \( D \)).

- **Algorithm Implementation:**
  - I developed a **Python script** to implement Bayesian estimation for cost prediction.
  - The model updates as new data is fed, continuously improving its accuracy.
  - This approach provides a **more robust and adaptive forecasting system** compared to traditional statistical methods.

**Conclusion**  
To summarize, my work involved:
1. **Organizing data** efficiently using Python and Excel.
2. Experimenting with the **inverse chain method**, which proved to be ineffective.
3. Exploring alternative methods like **GAM**, which yielded better results.
4. Implementing a **Bayesian approach** for future cost estimation, providing an adaptive and reliable forecasting tool.

Through this process, I learned the importance of testing different methods, analyzing their effectiveness, and continuously refining the approach to achieve better accuracy. I hope this presentation provided you with insights into my work. Thank you for your time, and I welcome any questions you may have.
